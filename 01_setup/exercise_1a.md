# Exercise 1A: Find Stuff

## Goals

- Familiarize yourself with the golang.org website and resources

## Setup

- Visit `golang.org`

## Directions

Answer the following questions

1. Read about `for loops` in the _Effective Go_ document

- What kind of loop doesn’t exist in Go? There is no do-while.

2. Read about the `fmt` _package_

- What does `fmt.Println()` return? The Println versions insert a blank between arguments and append a newline to the output while the Print versions add blanks only if the operand on neither side is a string.

3. Find a _blog post_ about the recent release of Go 1.13

- What are some of the new features?
the following number literals will be valid:

    0b100 – binary literal
    0o427 – octal literal
    0x1p2 or 0x1p-2 – hexadecimal floating-point literals
In addition, _ (underscore) can now be used as a digit separator in number literals, to improve the readability of big numbers such as 1_000_000 instead of 1000000.

 It will be possible to skip the conversion from a signed integer to unsigned integer before using it as a shift count
